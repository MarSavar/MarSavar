### hey.

I'm a software engineer based in London.\
Since joining [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) in 2021, I've contributed to the commercial codebase and worked alongside investigative journalists, using technology to uncover stories. Currently, I'm a developer in the mobile server-side team.

I speak Italian, English and Japanese, and I can get by in French and Spanish.

I enjoy, in no particular order: contemporary fiction, cycling, experimenting with [Rust](https://www.rustlang.com/).
