### hey.

I'm a software engineering fellow at [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/), currently working in the Investigations and Reporting team.
Prior to this, I worked in book publishing for four and a half years at [PRH](https://www.penguin.co.uk/).

I speak Italian, English and Japanese, and I can get by in French and Spanish.

I'm currently learning Rust in my spare time.
